# For Developers

## Project Structure
The code is located in **src/luxrender**. 

* **core** Most of the main work (rendering loop, material previews) starts here. 
* **export** All geometry export happens here, also all materials defined in the old material editor (panel-based) are exported here. Note: nodetree export functions are defined in **properties**. The **luxcore** subfolder contains the LuxCore API export routines.
* **extensions_framework** Abstraction code for LuxBlend's data structures
* **operators** All operators are located here.
* **outputs** API specific stuff.
* **properties** Definitions of LuxBlend datastructures (e.g. materials, lamp settings, export settings, basically every panel you see in the UI). This also includes the node editor as well as the Classic/LuxCore export routines for material and volume nodetrees.
* **ui** Drawing of UI elements happens here. Most of the time this is just a call to the corresponding property group (defined in **properties/**), but sometimes we need more control than those can offer, so there's also "Blender-Style" UI code.
